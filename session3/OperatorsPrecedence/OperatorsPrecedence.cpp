/**
 * @brief OperatorsPrecedenceExample
 * There are several operators in C++ which we use to perfom operations  with
 * progran variables and can be aritmetic (+, -, * /), comparison (==, != < >),
 * logical (&& || !) bitwise (&,  | ^ ~), assignment (= +=), specials (?, cast)
 * and several, you can find a complete list on
 * https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_operators.htm
 * The operators precedence determine the order in which operations are performed
 * or the grouping of terms in an expression. Operators with higuer precedence are
 * evaluated first.
